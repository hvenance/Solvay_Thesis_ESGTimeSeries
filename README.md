###### "The financial impact of Covid-19: a sectoral and geographical event study of the performance and resilience of portfolios composed of European ESG best-in-class stocks"

### Abstract: 
This research endeavors to examine the differential performance and resilience of high-scoring ESG firms in comparison to their low-scoring peers during the COVID-19 shock, and to identify the underlying financial factors contributing to these outcomes. With this intent, three analyses have been performed. That is, the implementation of advanced methodologies to evaluate the resilience and idiosyncratic risk of ESG best-in-class stocks during the pandemic, the comprehensive examination of the effects of the pandemic on multiple industries throughout Europe countries by means of the event study methodology, and the in-depth analysis of the financial performance variations and drivers across sectors. In the immediate future, the results of this study emphasize the importance for investors, policy-makers, and financial institutions to reevaluate their approach towards ESG best-in-class investing.

The uploaded files encompass the main statistical analyses conducted in my Master Thesis (see related pdf). Any comment is greatly appreciated and I
would be eager to discuss and look at this thrilling topic of ESG investments analyses more thoroughly.
